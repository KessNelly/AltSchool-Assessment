      <ol>
        <!--Preparatory Phase-->
        <li>
          Start by grinding the spices. Add them all together (ataiko, Irugege
          and a cup of crayfish), blend to powder. Blend the pepper as well.
          Wash the dried fish and remove center bones.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash and precook the prawn- use half a cup of water, a seasoning cube
          and a pinch of salt.
          <br />
          Precook your meat – Wash properly and use two seasoning cubes and a
          pinch of salt. Cook the meat until it becomes easy to chew, and the
          water is almost dried. Add salt to taste and allow another three
          minutes. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boil the palm fruit for 20 minutes, pound with a mortar and pestle,
          transfer into a bowl, add water and extract the juice, don’t add too
          much water, you want it thick. You will need about 7-10 cups of the
          palm fruit juice for this soup. It should be thick.
        </li>

        <!--Cooking Phase-->
        <li>
          Use a sieve to strain the extract into your cooked meat amd allow to
          boil for 15mins
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the cleaned dried fish, ground (crayfish, ataiko plus irugege),
          oburunbebe stick, ground pepper, and salt to taste. Cover and allow
          another 10 minutes. You can add a little water if it is too thick
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the crushed dried beletientien leaves, precooked prawn,
          periwinkles and one cube of knorr. Stir, cover and allow to simmer for
